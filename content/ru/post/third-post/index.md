## My week. 3.

When life gives you mint leaves, what do you make? This mint mojito recipe!

**INGREDIENTS:**

Here’s what you’ll need to make this mint mojito recipe:

- **Fresh mint** – The star of this classic cocktail! You’ll muddle some mint leaves to infuse the drink with flavor and add more to your glass for garnish.
- **White rum** – Jack and I are fans of 10 Cane and Bacardi Silver Rum, but any white rum would work here. Feel free to use your favorite!
- **Fresh lime juice** – It adds bright, tart flavor. Always, always use freshly squeezed lime juice in this mojito recipe.
- **Simple syrup** – Classic mojito recipes call for sugar, but I like to use simple syrup in its place. It streamlines the recipe, as you don’t need to muddle the sugar with the lime and mint. Simple syrup keeps for several weeks in the fridge, so I like to keep it on hand for anytime I’m in the mood for a fun drink.
- **Club soda or sparkling water** – It balances the tart lime and alcohol and gives the cocktail a fun fizz.
- **Ice** – You can’t make a cool, refreshing mojito without it!

**STEPS:**

Ready to learn how to make a mojito? Here’s what you need to do:

1. **First, muddle the mint.** Place it in the bottom of a cocktail shaker and use a cocktail muddler to press it until it becomes aromatic. When you’re muddling the mint, your goal isn’t to pulverize it or crush it. Instead, just bruise it slightly to help it release its fragrant oils. This should only take a few taps with your muddler!
1. **Second, shake!** Add the rum, lime juice, simple syrup, and a handful of ice to the cocktail shaker, and shake it vigorously until the ingredients are completely combined and chilled.
1. **Then, strain your mojito.** Strain the contents of the cocktail shaker over a glass filled with ice. Top your glass with soda water, and garnish it with lime slices and more fresh mint sprigs.
1. **Finally, taste and adjust.** This step is essential anytime you’re making a cocktail at home. It gives you a chance to customize your drink to your tastes, finding a balance of flavors you really love. If you prefer a tarter mojito, add an extra squeeze of lime juice. If you want it sweeter, stir in a bit more simple syrup. Not strong enough? Well, you know what to do.

Enjoy!
